<p>Subrequests is a request aggregator project that will allow you to turn multiple
requests into a single one. To do so client-side applications describe the
requests they want to do in a JSON document and send that document to the
server. In turn, the server interprets that document, called <em>blueprint</em>, and
executes all the those requests in the clients behalf.</p>
<p>There are two big benefits when using this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is only one round trip between server an client. The client to server
communications may be weak (ex: over 3G), but the server to server
communications are always very reliable.</li>
<li>If your requests are resolved by the same server processing the blueprints,
you eliminate completaly the latency introduced by sequential requests. That
introduces a dramatic performance improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subrequests is implemented as a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/subrequests">Drupal module</a>
and as an <a href="https://github.com/e0ipso/subrequests-express">express middleware</a>.
ContentaJS relies on the nodejs implementation of the
<a href="http://cgit.drupalcode.org/subrequests/tree/SPECIFICATION.md">Subrequests specification</a>,
which is exposed in the <code>/subrequests</code> route.</p>

subrequests to reduce communications latency and improve application performance
